# Slime, Blood and Pain

Welcome to the Dungeon!

You are doomed to die in a randomly-generated dungeon, inhabitated by not really friendly creatures: cute slimes, some skeletons, creepy multi-eye monsters...

Luckily, you won't need to rely only on your fists: inside the dungeon you'll be able to find hearts that can heal you (and some that will poison you), and you can also improve your equipment... at a cost. A cost in blood...

## Controls

`Arrow keys` - Select a direction  
`A` - Switch to Attack Mode (Attack in the selected direction)  
`Escape` - Switch to Move Mode (Move in the selected direction)

Some skeletons decided to wield a bow instead of a sword, and will shoot you from far away.

# A final note

_We salvaged this in the last Game Jam day from an unplayable mess. It's an awful disaster of code, sprites, and even some audio?_
